Writing is understanding.\nWhen you write – or speak – about a topic several things happen. You are forced to form complete sentences and express the idea as clear as you can. While you do, you might discover that you are still missing pieces or that your current understanding is wrong is some way. Another thing you might notice is, that you are unsure, if it is correct.

My hope is to write about topics where I am on the way up from the valley of despair (Dunning–Kruger effect) or make the valley not as deep. I currently only write into my personal notes – mainly for documentation and findability. But it is too easy to just jot down bullet points and not actually understanding what you have written. I hope blogging deepens my understanding of things and also helps others understand the topic a little bit better.\nInspiration I read some other tech blogs like Florian Haas, Michael Stapelberg, and Kristian Köhntopp. I hugely respect all of them and enjoy their different content.
