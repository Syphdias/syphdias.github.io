But in all seriousness, network design should come first and not be subject to constant change (unless you want to hire me).\nWhen checking the Ceph documentation, I was pleasantly surprised! I made my fair share of negative experiences with Ceph Docs (web and cli help) but this part improved quite a bit for such a niche procedure.\nIn this I will go through the documented ways of how to change the network. I will go through a more thorough example of the process including things not at the core of the change and how to deal with them.\nThere are currently three documented ways to change Network/IPs.\n“The Right Way” Screenshot from the official Ceph documentation\nWhile old documentation called it “The Right Way”, it is now called the “Preferred Method”.\nI wouldn’t even call it changing a Ceph Mon’s IP since it basically adds a new Ceph Mon with a new IP, wait for the quorum, remove the old Ceph Mon, rinse and repeat.\nThe documentation only suggest to do this in a manual fashion but in practice cephadm and rook should make this trivially easy with changing the service definition to relocate the Ceph Mons, as long as…\n…the new IPs are within the current network or at least reachable.\n“The Messy Way” While old documentation called it “The Messy Way”, it is now called “Advanced Method” — a bit boring, if you ask me since it can get messy, if you are unprepared.\nThe high-level step by step is basically:\nStop the cluster Export the monmap Edit the monmap to remove/add Ceph Mons Inject monmap into Ceph Mons Start Mons, then rest of cluster This leaves out a few things like changing the public_network in the configuration database and how to deal with daemons and all the messiness that might come after.\n“The Third Way” Okay, I lied. There is no third way but a more detailed version of “The Messy Way” using cephadm.\nThe high-level steps are the same, but this time done within cephadm shell including the resolution of some of the messiness and it still assumes you know how to get around your setup — if you don’t, please abort and ask for help!\nMy Take With My (Customer’s) Idiosyncrasies First off, start with a healthy cluster, if you can!\nSecondly, backup monmap, configuration, and keyrings where you can reach it (not /tmp of cephadm shell container or similar).\nMake sure you are prepared and that you communicated the change — duh‽ I will mention some things outside the cluster to look out for at the end.\nI want to prevent data movement of any kind. It is probably not needed but I like the precaution.\nceph osd set noout ceph osd set norebalance ceph osd set nobackfill Stopping all Ceph services using Ansible and prevent them from starting when the hosts will be rebooted for the network changes to be properly applied.\nansible ceph_hosts -m systemd -a 'name=ceph.target state=stopped enabled=false' -b On one of the hosts I do more or less what “The Third Way” says. I change my monmap but with two important changes:\nUsing a volume for the cephadm shell to easily extract monmap Only doing this once and then injecting the same monmap into all Ceph Mons while the documentation suggests repeating the edit process for all Ceph Mons root@ceph01:~# cephadm shell --name mon.ceph01 --mount /root:/roothome Inferring fsid f52ba149-31ea-4da9-9b11-17e745e20d35 Inferring config /var/lib/ceph/f52ba149-31ea-4da9-9b11-17e745e20d35/mon.ceph01/config Using recent ceph image quay.io/ceph/ceph@sha256:1b9158ce28975f95def6a0ad459fa19f1336506074267a4b47c1bd914a00fec0 root@ceph01:/# cd /roothome/ root@ceph01:/roothome# ceph-mon -i ceph01 --extract-monmap monmap-$(date +%F) 2025-11-05T08:56:17.050+0000 70bab6991834 -1 wrote monmap to monmap-2025-11-05 root@ceph01:/roothome# cp monmap-2025-11-05{,-new} This is the time to go to another terminal, and back up the old monmap now!

When I did this, I accidentally added another Ceph Mon that did not exist. Since there were still enough Ceph Mons to have a quorum, and this change needed to be done during a cluster downtime, I was not worried about temporarily losing quorum. This would also only happen if two more Ceph Mons failed or did not come up right away. I later removed the extra Ceph Mon after the existing Ceph Mons were up again.\nI did not want to do these steps for every Ceph Mon host, so I copied the new monmap to the relevant hosts.\nfor i in {02..05}; do ssh ceph01 sudo cat /root/monmap-2025-11-05-new \\ | ssh ceph$i sudo tee /root/monmap-2025-11-05-new \u003e /dev/null done I ran the following commands to inject the monmap on each one of them, quick and dirty as well.\nfor i in {01..05}; do ssh ceph$i \"sudo cephadm shell --mount /root:/roothome --name mon.ceph$i \\ ceph-mon -i ceph$i --inject-monmap /roothome/monmap-2025-11-05-new\" done I updated /var/lib/ceph/{FSID}/mon.{MON}/config on every host by replacing the IPs in the config.\nSo far this was only preparations for the network change. In my case the network configuration is managed by an Ansible role, and I already made the necessary changes. This is the point of no return annoying rollback, if one would be needed for any reason.\nNote: For rolling back I would inject the old monmap for all Ceph Mons. After changing the network configuration on the hosts and the switches, this might be harder as I might not be able to easily connect to the hosts to deploy the old network configuration.\nansible-playbook site.yaml -t ceph_networking -D Since I am not in charge of the network hardware, this was the time to talk to the networking people, so they would switch over to the new configuration.\nansible ceph_hosts -m reboot -b After the reboots I checked the network using another Ansible script, that would check for bond failures, negotiated speed, VLAN tags, and finally pinging from every host to every other host on public and cluster network using jumbo frames. Depending on the cluster size this takes a while but is worth the effort in my experience to not run into weird issues due to missing MTU on some interfaces or other configuration errors (hardware or software).\nNote: To ping from everywhere to everywhere it builds a list of IPs filtered by CIDRs and loops over this list on every host.\nansible-playbook check-network.yaml Restart the cluster, if everything is okay.\nansible ceph_hosts -m systemd -a 'name=ceph.target state=started enabled=true' -b Setting public_network. I am not sure why it is set on mon and global level, but there is no harm updating both.\nceph config set mon public_network 192.168.160.128/24 ceph config set global public_network 192.168.160.128/24 Fixing Ceph Mgr config:\nceph config generate-minimal-conf \u003e/var/lib/ceph/f52ba149-31ea-4da9-9b11-17e745e20d35/mgr.ceph01.yeinoh/config systemctl reset-failed ceph-f52ba149-31ea-4da9-9b11-17e745e20d35@mgr.ceph01.yeinoh systemctl start $_ Since the orchestrator does not know the new IPs yet, I needed to set them.\nceph orch host set-addr ceph01 192.168.160.1 # repeated for all hosts It will take a few minutes for the orchestrator to gather all information from every host again.\nThe documentation only mentions one last command to reconfigure the Ceph OSDs before it leaves you with the rest to fix for yourself. For example, to get a working standby Ceph Mgr and some other services I ran ceph orch reconfig for all services on this cluster, including Ceph Mons to ensure there is no residue config referencing the old network.\nceph orch reconfig osd ceph orch reconfig mgr ceph orch reconfig mds ceph orch reconfig mon ceph orch reconfig rgw Note: I guess ceph orch redeploy $service would work as well but would take longer.\nNow we unset the flags to allow the cluster to function again normally.\nceph osd unset noout ceph osd unset norebalance ceph osd unset nobackfill Now for the supporting services, that need to be checked for functionality and I will try to include all relevant ones (including unused ones in this case):\nCeph Mgr should provide Ceph Dashboard with proper certificates and Ceph Exporter Observability tooling should be functional: Prometheus, Node-Exporter, Loki, Promtail, Grafana, Alertmanager If you scrape from another external Prometheus you might need to change IPs to be scraped there If there are custom containers, e.g. S3 usage exporter, they should still be reachable Sync services functional: RGW Sync, RBD Mirror, and CephFS Mirror Change DNS RR(set)s for RGWs, etc. Lastly the RADOS clients (RGW, RBD, CephFS) need to be reconfigured to be able to communicate with the cluster again.\nAnd if there are firewalls in place, their rules should be updated beforehand; on hosts (iptables/nftables) and on centralized firewall appliances.\nConclusion While it is possible and fairly straight forward to move a cluster to another or multiple other networks, I would advice avoiding the procedure. You might end up with no cluster at all, if you are not able to fix issues along the way. Even if you do not make mistakes during the process you might still encounter new hurdles with later versions or something might fail during the process.\nUnderstanding how to heal your cluster in an emergency is vital and you should have the ability to do so, if you attempt this.\nThis procedure really should not be a regular occurrence, which is why I did not automate it the first time I had to do it and not the second time either.\n","wordCount":"1744","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-11-05T20:11:02+01:00","dateModified":"2025-11-05T20:11:02+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.relg.uk/posts/killing-ceph-by-changing-networks/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"relg.uk","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.relg.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark"),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){sessionStorage.getItem("nthLoad")?(document.getElementById("logo").classList.remove("logo-first-load"),document.getElementById("logo").classList.add("logo-nth-load")):sessionStorage.setItem("nthLoad","true")})</script><style>.logo{display:flex;font-family:MesloLGS NF,monospace;font-size:2em;cursor:pointer}.logo span{display:inline-block}.logo-first-load span{animation-delay:1s}@keyframes char1{0%{transform:translateX(0)}100%{transform:translateX(5ch)}}@keyframes char2{0%{transform:translateX(0)}100%{transform:translateX(3ch)}}@keyframes char3{0%{transform:translateX(0)}100%{transform:translateX(1ch)}}@keyframes char4{0%{transform:translateX(0)}100%{transform:translateX(-1ch)}}@keyframes char5{0%{transform:translateX(0);opacity:1}100%{transform:translateX(-2ch);opacity:0}}@keyframes char6{0%{transform:translateX(0)}100%{transform:translateX(-4ch)}}@keyframes char7{0%{transform:translateX(0)}100%{transform:translateX(-6ch)}}.logo-first-load span:nth-child(1){animation:char1 .5s ease 1s forwards}.logo-first-load span:nth-child(2){animation:char2 .5s ease 1s forwards}.logo-first-load span:nth-child(3){animation:char3 .5s ease 1s forwards}.logo-first-load span:nth-child(4){animation:char4 .5s ease 1s forwards}.logo-first-load span:nth-child(5){animation:char5 .5s ease 1s forwards}.logo-first-load span:nth-child(6){animation:char6 .5s ease 1s forwards}.logo-first-load span:nth-child(7){animation:char7 .5s ease 1s forwards}@keyframes char1r{0%{transform:translateX(5ch)}100%{transform:translateX(0)}}@keyframes char2r{0%{transform:translateX(3ch)}100%{transform:translateX(0)}}@keyframes char3r{0%{transform:translateX(1ch)}100%{transform:translateX(0)}}@keyframes char4r{0%{transform:translateX(-1ch)}100%{transform:translateX(0)}}@keyframes char5r{0%{transform:translateX(-2ch);opacity:0}100%{transform:translateX(0);opacity:1}}@keyframes char6r{0%{transform:translateX(-4ch)}100%{transform:translateX(0)}}@keyframes char7r{0%{transform:translateX(-6ch)}100%{transform:translateX(0)}}.logo-first-load:hover span{animation-delay:0s}.logo-first-load:hover span:nth-child(1){animation-name:char1r}.logo-first-load:hover span:nth-child(2){animation-name:char2r}.logo-first-load:hover span:nth-child(3){animation-name:char3r}.logo-first-load:hover span:nth-child(4){animation-name:char4r}.logo-first-load:hover span:nth-child(5){animation-name:char5r}.logo-first-load:hover span:nth-child(6){animation-name:char6r}.logo-first-load:hover span:nth-child(7){animation-name:char7r}.logo-nth-load span{transition:transform .5s ease,opacity .5s ease}.logo-nth-load:hover span:nth-child(1){transform:translateX(5ch)}.logo-nth-load:hover span:nth-child(2){transform:translateX(3ch)}.logo-nth-load:hover span:nth-child(3){transform:translateX(1ch)}.logo-nth-load:hover span:nth-child(4){transform:translateX(-1ch)}.logo-nth-load:hover span:nth-child(5){transform:translateX(-2ch);opacity:0}.logo-nth-load:hover span:nth-child(6){transform:translateX(-4ch)}.logo-nth-load:hover span:nth-child(7){transform:translateX(-6ch)}</style><header class=header><nav class=nav><div id=logo class="logo logo-first-load"><a href=https://www.relg.uk/ accesskey=h title="relg.uk (Alt + H)"><span>r</span><span>e</span><span>l</span><span>g</span><span>.</span><span>u</span><span>k</span></a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">

multiple other networks, I would advice avoiding the procedure. You might end up
with no cluster at all, if you are not able to fix issues along the way. Even if
you do not make mistakes during the process you might still encounter new
hurdles with later versions or something might fail during the process.</p><p>Understanding how to heal your cluster in an emergency is vital and you should
have the ability to do so, if you attempt this.</p><p>This procedure really should not be a regular occurrence, which is why I did not
automate it the first time I had to do it and not the second time either.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://www.relg.uk/>relg.uk</a></span> ·
